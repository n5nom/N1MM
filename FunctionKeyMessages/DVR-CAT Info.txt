Kenwood
Typical Kenwood radio defaults:
Speed: 9600 Baud; Parity: N ;Databits: 8; Stopbits: 2 and "hardware handshaking" (RTS and DTR set to "Handshake"). It is recommended by the developers to use a baud rate above 9600 baud if possible. The radio menu and the program setup must be changed together.
When setting split both VFOs are forced in the same mode.
Assigning these basic example macros to Function Keys will allow you to play and stop the internal DVK (voice keyer) on radio #1. Other macro strings can be inserted to playback on radio #2 or both radios. See the Macros section of the manual.
Message1 = {CAT1ASC PB1;}
Message2 = {CAT1ASC PB2;}
Message3 = {CAT1ASC PB3;}
Stop Playback = {CAT1ASC PB0;}
The TS-590 DVK stop command is sent to the radio when the ESC key is pressed.
